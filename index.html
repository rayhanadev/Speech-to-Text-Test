				<p>
					Speech recognition involves receiving speech through a device's microphone,
					which is then checked by a speech recognition service against a list of
					grammar (basically, the vocabulary you want to have recognized in a particular
					app.) When a word or phrase is successfully recognized, it is returned as a result
					(or list of results) as a text string, and further actions can be initiated as a
					result.

			<p>
				The below two examples use the Web Speech API. It only works on Chrome and
				Safari currently.
			</p>
	
			<h2>Example 1</h2>
		
			<p>
				This example will record audio and then transcribe what was spoken to text,
				as well as present the accuracy of the transcription.
			</p>

			<p><button type="button" id="startExample1">Start</button> &nbsp; <span id="action1">Press the button to start!</span></p>
	
			<form>
				<label for="output1">Output</label>
				<textarea id="output1" type="textarea" readonly rows="4"></textarea>
			</form>

			<h2>Example 2</h2>

			<p>
				This example uses a predefined list of correct values to choose a CSS color
				and then set the <code>background-color</code> property of the input to the
				spoken color.
			</p>

			<p><button type="button" id="startExample2">Start</button> &nbsp; <span id="action2">Dicatate a CSS color value!</span></p>
	
			<form>
				<label for="output2">Output</label>
				<input id="output2" type="text" readonly></input>
			</form>
