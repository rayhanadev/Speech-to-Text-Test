# Speech 2 Text

Testing Chrome's [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API)
for a Speech Recognition project.

> Speech recognition involves receiving speech through a device's microphone,
> which is then checked by a speech recognition service against a list of
> grammar (basically, the vocabulary you want to have recognized in a particular
> app.) When a word or phrase is successfully recognized, it is returned as a result
> (or list of results) as a text string, and further actions can be initiated as a
> result.
